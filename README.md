# LEO Belt GitHub
The low-vision enhancement optoelectronic (LEO) belt is a non-invasive wearable device that is designed to help people with PVL. This is accomplished using a depth-sensing camera that splits the environment in front of the user into eight sections and sending signals to vibrating boxes corresponding to these sections placed on the chest, waist and legs. The vibration of these boxes increases the closer an object is to the user. This offers the user a better sense of immersion in their surrounding environment. The device consists of a fitted undershirt with five pockets that house the vibration boxes. An additional two vibration boxes are attached to the user’s ankles for further immersion. The device is completely portable and is lightweight so as to not affect the user’s mobility.
